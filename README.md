# LMZ14203-Power-Module-Board
Repository for the LMZ14203 Power Module Simple Switcher DC-DC Converter Board 3.3V/5.0V

This [DC-DC converter Power Module](https://www.tindie.com/products/ivorycircuits/lmz14203-power-module-33v50v3a-max-fpgasmcus/) was specially designed for FPGA/MCU projects that require stable voltage and high power delivery on a compact size board.

**Characteristics:**

1. Based on the [LMZ14203](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmz14203.pdf?&ts=1589876302876), part of the Simple Switcher(R) family from TI delivers clean voltage with an efficiency of up to 92% (@ 1 Aout, 12 Vin)
2. Max Input Voltage: 32V
3. Max Output Current: 3A (absolute maximum)
4. High-Current Input [Ferrite](https://ds.yuden.co.jp/TYCOMPAS/ut/detail?pn=FBMH3225HM601NT++&u=M), rated at 3 Amax, 600 Ohm @ 100 MHz for high-frequency cancelation
5. Highly-stitched ground PCB design
6. This board has been designed and populated with high-quality components only.
6. Easy 3.3V/5.0V selection through a flip of a switch. Note: **DO NOT** hot-swap the voltage (while load or Vin are connected). Disconnect the board before selecting the output voltage.

If you need access to the CAD files, please get in touch. The first one was a small batch that might need some minor improvements based on your kind feedback and comments. However, based on my tests, so far, so good! I will upload the final version once the design is mature enough. KiCAD design available only!

Cheers!
